# OpenClaw RTT

Time-series store for OpenClaw Telegram RTT measurements.

The measurement harness lives in `openclaw/openclaw`. This repo stores normalized results and later graph/dashboard code.

## Import A Run

From this repo:

```sh
node scripts/import-result.mjs ../clawdbot/runs/<run-id>/result.json
node scripts/summary.mjs
```

Expected source shape is the `result.json` emitted by:

```sh
pnpm rtt openclaw@beta
pnpm rtt openclaw@latest
pnpm rtt openclaw@2026.4.30 --provider live-frontier
```

## Data

- `data/rtt.jsonl`: append-only graph source, one normalized run per line.
- `runs/<run-id>/result.json`: copied per-run result record for audit/debug.

Raw Telegram QA artifacts stay in the OpenClaw repo artifact directory unless explicitly copied in later.
